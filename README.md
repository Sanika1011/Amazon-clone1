# Amazon-clone
Project Description: Amazon Clone Website

This project is a simplified version of the Amazon e-commerce website, where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders. The project is built using the following tech stack:

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python with Django for the server-side logic and middleware.
Frontend/UI: HTML and CSS for creating the structure and styling of the web pages. JavaScript for dynamic content and interaction.
Database: MySQL to store user information, product data, orders, and other necessary details.

Features:

User Authentication: User login, registration, and session management.
Product Catalog: Users can view and search for products available in different categories.
Shopping Cart: Users can add, remove, and manage items in their shopping cart.
Order Management: Users can place orders, view past orders, and track their status.
Admin Dashboard: Admin users can add, edit, and delete product listings.

Functionality:

Backend:
The backend is built using Django, which handles routing, database management, and business logic. The system uses MySQL for storing user details, products, and orders.

Frontend: 
The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website interactive. JavaScript is used for client-side operations like updating the cart dynamically without reloading the page.

Database: 
MySQL is used to store data for users, products, orders, and transactions. The Django ORM is used to interact with the MySQL database seamlessly.
This project demonstrates the core features of an e-commerce website and showcases skills in backend development with Django, frontend design, and database management with MySQL.
